 Mandatory on all AAMVA driver's license versions.

 Possible values "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "Compact" and

 AAMVA Version Number: This is a value between "00" and "99" that

 is reserved for bar codes printed to the specification of the American Association
 of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) prior to the adoption of the AAMVA DL/ID-2000
 standard. All bar codes compliant with the AAMVA DL/ID-2000 standard are designated
 Version "01." All barcodes compliant with AAMVA Card Design Specification version
 1.0, dated 09-2003 shall be designated Version "02." All barcodes compliant with
 AAMVA Card Design Specification version 2.0, dated 03-2005 shall be designated
 Version "03." All barcodes compliant with AAMVA Card Design Standard version 1.0,
 dated 07-2009 shall be designated Version "04." All barcodes compliant with AAMVA

 Standard version 1.0, dated 06-2012 shall be designated Version "07". All barcodes
 compliant with this current AAMVA standard shall be designated "08". Should a need
 arise requiring major revision to the format, this field provides the means to
 accommodate additional revision. "Compact" when Compact encoding is used.
