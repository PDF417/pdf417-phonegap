@brief Artificial Neural Networks - Multi-Layer Perceptrons.

Unlike many other models in ML that are constructed and trained at once, in the MLP model these
steps are separated. First, a network with the specified topology is created using the non-default
constructor or the method ANN_MLP::create. All the weights are set to zeros. Then, the network is
trained using a set of input and output vectors. The training procedure can be repeated more than
once, that is, the weights can be adjusted based on the new training data.

@brief The array of a priori class probabilities, sorted by the class label value.

    The parameter can be used to tune the decision tree preferences toward a certain class. For
    example, if you want to detect some rare anomaly occurrence, the training base will likely
    contain much more normal cases than anomalies, so a very good classification performance
    will be achieved just by considering every case as normal. To avoid this, the priors can be
    specified, where the anomaly probability is artificially increased (up to 0.5 or even
    greater), so the weight of the misclassified anomalies becomes much bigger, and the tree is
    adjusted properly.

    You can also think about this parameter as weights of prediction categories which determine
    relative weights that you give to misclassification. That is, if the weight of the first
    category is 1 and the weight of the second category is 10, then each mistake in predicting
    the second category is equivalent to making 10 mistakes in predicting the first category.

@brief Estimate the Gaussian mixture parameters from a samples set.

    This variation starts with Expectation step. Initial values of the model parameters will be
    estimated by the k-means algorithm.

    Unlike many of the ML models, %EM is an unsupervised learning algorithm and it does not take
    responses (class labels or function values) as input. Instead, it computes the *Maximum
    Likelihood Estimate* of the Gaussian mixture parameters from an input sample set, stores all the
    parameters inside the structure: \f$p_{i,k}\f$ in probs, \f$a_k\f$ in means , \f$S_k\f$ in
    covs[k], \f$\pi_k\f$ in weights , and optionally computes the output "class label" for each
    sample: \f$\texttt{labels}_i=\texttt{arg max}_k(p_{i,k}), i=1..N\f$ (indices of the most
    probable mixture component for each sample).

    The trained model can be used further for prediction, just like any other classifier. The
    trained model is similar to the NormalBayesClassifier.

    @param samples Samples from which the Gaussian mixture model will be estimated. It should be a
        one-channel matrix, each row of which is a sample. If the matrix does not have CV_64F type
        it will be converted to the inner matrix of such type for the further computing.
    @param logLikelihoods The optional output matrix that contains a likelihood logarithm value for
        each sample. It has \f$nsamples \times 1\f$ size and CV_64FC1 type.
    @param labels The optional output "class label" for each sample:
        \f$\texttt{labels}_i=\texttt{arg max}_k(p_{i,k}), i=1..N\f$ (indices of the most probable
        mixture component for each sample). It has \f$nsamples \times 1\f$ size and CV_32SC1 type.
    @param probs The optional output matrix that contains posterior probabilities of each Gaussian
        mixture component given the each sample. It has \f$nsamples \times nclusters\f$ size and

@brief Trains an %SVM with optimal parameters.

    @param data the training data that can be constructed using TrainData::create or

    @param kFold Cross-validation parameter. The training set is divided into kFold subsets. One
        subset is used to test the model, the others form the train set. So, the %SVM algorithm is

    @param balanced If true and the problem is 2-class classification then the method creates more
        balanced cross-validation subsets that is proportions between classes in subsets are close
        to such proportion in the whole train dataset.

    The method trains the %SVM model automatically by choosing the optimal parameters C, gamma, p,
    nu, coef0, degree. Parameters are considered optimal when the cross-validation
    estimate of the test set error is minimal.

    If there is no need to optimize a parameter, the corresponding grid step should be set to any
    value less than or equal to 1. For example, to avoid optimization in gamma, set `gammaGrid.step
    = 0`, `gammaGrid.minVal`, `gamma_grid.maxVal` as arbitrary numbers. In this case, the value
    `Gamma` is taken for gamma.

    And, finally, if the optimization in a parameter is required but the corresponding grid is
    unknown, you may call the function SVM::getDefaultGrid. To generate a grid, for example, for
    gamma, call `SVM::getDefaultGrid(SVM::GAMMA)`.

    This function works for the classification (SVM::C_SVC or SVM::NU_SVC) as well as for the
    regression (SVM::EPS_SVR or SVM::NU_SVR). If it is SVM::ONE_CLASS, no optimization is made and
    the usual %SVM with parameters specified in params is executed.

    @param responseEndIdx Index of the last output variable + 1. If -1, then there is single
        response variable at responseStartIdx.
    @param varTypeSpec The optional text string that specifies the variables' types. It has the
        format `ord[n1-n2,n3,n4-n5,...]cat[n6,n7-n8,...]`. That is, variables from `n1 to n2`
        (inclusive range), `n3`, `n4 to n5` ... are considered ordered and `n6`, `n7 to n8` ... are
        considered as categorical. The range `[n1..n2] + [n3] + [n4..n5] + ... + [n6] + [n7..n8]`
        should cover all the variables. If varTypeSpec is not specified, then algorithm uses the
        following rules:
        - all input variables are considered ordered by default. If some column contains has non-
          numerical values, e.g. 'apple', 'pear', 'apple', 'apple', 'mango', the corresponding
          variable is considered categorical.
        - if there are several output variables, they are all considered as ordered. Error is
          reported when non-numerical values are used.
        - if there is a single output variable, then if its values are non-numerical or are all
          integers, then it's considered categorical. Otherwise, it's considered ordered.
    @param delimiter The character used to separate values in each line.
    @param missch The character used to specify missing measurements. It should not be a digit.
        Although it's a non-numerical value, it surely does not affect the decision of whether the
        variable ordered or categorical.

@brief Displays an image in the specified window.

@param winname Name of the window.
@param mat Image to be shown.

The function imshow displays an image in the specified window. If the window was created with the
CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE flag, the image is shown with its original size, however it is still limited by the screen resolution.
Otherwise, the image is scaled to fit the window. The function may scale the image, depending on its depth:

-   If the image is 8-bit unsigned, it is displayed as is.
-   If the image is 16-bit unsigned or 32-bit integer, the pixels are divided by 256. That is, the
    value range [0,255\*256] is mapped to [0,255].
-   If the image is 32-bit floating-point, the pixel values are multiplied by 255. That is, the
    value range [0,1] is mapped to [0,255].

If window was created with OpenGL support, imshow also support ogl::Buffer , ogl::Texture2D and
cuda::GpuMat as input.

If the window was not created before this function, it is assumed creating a window with CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE.

If you need to show an image that is bigger than the screen resolution, you will need to call namedWindow("", WINDOW_NORMAL) before the imshow.

@note This function should be followed by waitKey function which displays the image for specified
milliseconds. Otherwise, it won't display the image. For example, waitKey(0) will display the window
infinitely until any keypress (it is suitable for image display). waitKey(25) will display a frame
for 25 ms, after which display will be automatically closed. (If you put it in a loop to read
videos, it will display the video frame-by-frame)

@note

The function waitKey waits for a key event infinitely (when \f$\texttt{delay}\leq 0\f$ ) or for delay

Qt backend supports additional flags:
 -   **CV_WINDOW_NORMAL or CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE:** CV_WINDOW_NORMAL enables you to resize the

 -   **CV_WINDOW_FREERATIO or CV_WINDOW_KEEPRATIO:** CV_WINDOW_FREERATIO adjusts the image

@param filename Name of file to be loaded.
@param flags Flag that can take values of @ref cv::ImreadModes

The function imread loads an image from the specified file and returns it. If the image cannot be
read (because of missing file, improper permissions, unsupported or invalid format), the function
returns an empty matrix ( Mat::data==NULL ). Currently, the following file formats are supported:

-   Windows bitmaps - \*.bmp, \*.dib (always supported)
-   JPEG files - \*.jpeg, \*.jpg, \*.jpe (see the *Notes* section)
-   JPEG 2000 files - \*.jp2 (see the *Notes* section)
-   Portable Network Graphics - \*.png (see the *Notes* section)
-   WebP - \*.webp (see the *Notes* section)
-   Portable image format - \*.pbm, \*.pgm, \*.ppm (always supported)
-   Sun rasters - \*.sr, \*.ras (always supported)
-   TIFF files - \*.tiff, \*.tif (see the *Notes* section)

@note

-   The function determines the type of an image by the content, not by the file extension.
-   On Microsoft Windows\* OS and MacOSX\*, the codecs shipped with an OpenCV image (libjpeg,
    libpng, libtiff, and libjasper) are used by default. So, OpenCV can always read JPEGs, PNGs,
    and TIFFs. On MacOSX, there is also an option to use native MacOSX image readers. But beware
    that currently these native image loaders give images with different pixel values because of
    the color management embedded into MacOSX.
-   On Linux\*, BSD flavors and other Unix-like open-source operating systems, OpenCV looks for
    codecs supplied with an OS image. Install the relevant packages (do not forget the development
    files, for example, "libjpeg-dev", in Debian\* and Ubuntu\*) to get the codec support or turn
    on the OPENCV_BUILD_3RDPARTY_LIBS flag in CMake.

@note In the case of color images, the decoded images will have the channels stored in B G R order.

    The function is simply a combination of fisheye::initUndistortRectifyMap (with unity R ) and remap
    (with bilinear interpolation). See the former function for details of the transformation being
    performed.

    See below the results of undistortImage.

@brief Creates StereoSGBM object

    @param minDisparity Minimum possible disparity value. Normally, it is zero but sometimes
    rectification algorithms can shift images, so this parameter needs to be adjusted accordingly.
    @param numDisparities Maximum disparity minus minimum disparity. The value is always greater than
    zero. In the current implementation, this parameter must be divisible by 16.
    @param blockSize Matched block size. It must be an odd number \&gt;=1 . Normally, it should be
    somewhere in the 3..11 range.
    @param P1 The first parameter controlling the disparity smoothness. See below.
    @param P2 The second parameter controlling the disparity smoothness. The larger the values are,
    the smoother the disparity is. P1 is the penalty on the disparity change by plus or minus 1
    between neighbor pixels. P2 is the penalty on the disparity change by more than 1 between neighbor
    pixels. The algorithm requires P2 \&gt; P1 . See stereo_match.cpp sample where some reasonably good
    P1 and P2 values are shown (like 8\*number_of_image_channels\*SADWindowSize\*SADWindowSize and
    32\*number_of_image_channels\*SADWindowSize\*SADWindowSize , respectively).
    @param disp12MaxDiff Maximum allowed difference (in integer pixel units) in the left-right
    disparity check. Set it to a non-positive value to disable the check.
    @param preFilterCap Truncation value for the prefiltered image pixels. The algorithm first
    computes x-derivative at each pixel and clips its value by [-preFilterCap, preFilterCap] interval.
    The result values are passed to the Birchfield-Tomasi pixel cost function.
    @param uniquenessRatio Margin in percentage by which the best (minimum) computed cost function
    value should "win" the second best value to consider the found match correct. Normally, a value
    within the 5-15 range is good enough.
    @param speckleWindowSize Maximum size of smooth disparity regions to consider their noise speckles
    and invalidate. Set it to 0 to disable speckle filtering. Otherwise, set it somewhere in the
    50-200 range.
    @param speckleRange Maximum disparity variation within each connected component. If you do speckle
    filtering, set the parameter to a positive value, it will be implicitly multiplied by 16.
    Normally, 1 or 2 is good enough.
    @param mode Set it to StereoSGBM::MODE_HH to run the full-scale two-pass dynamic programming
    algorithm. It will consume O(W\*H\*numDisparities) bytes, which is large for 640x480 stereo and
    huge for HD-size pictures. By default, it is set to false .

    The first constructor initializes StereoSGBM with all the default parameters. So, you only have to
    set StereoSGBM::numDisparities at minimum. The second constructor enables you to set each parameter
    to a custom value.

@brief The class implements the modified H. Hirschmuller algorithm @cite HH08 that differs from the original
one as follows:

-   By default, the algorithm is single-pass, which means that you consider only 5 directions
instead of 8. Set mode=StereoSGBM::MODE_HH in createStereoSGBM to run the full variant of the
algorithm but beware that it may consume a lot of memory.
-   The algorithm matches blocks, not individual pixels. Though, setting blockSize=1 reduces the
blocks to single pixels.
-   Mutual information cost function is not implemented. Instead, a simpler Birchfield-Tomasi
sub-pixel metric from @cite BT98 is used. Though, the color images are supported as well.
-   Some pre- and post- processing steps from K. Konolige algorithm StereoBM are included, for
example: pre-filtering (StereoBM::PREFILTER_XSOBEL type) and post-filtering (uniqueness
check, quadratic interpolation and speckle filtering).

rejected prior to computing the homographies. Otherwise,all the points are considered inliers.

The function computes the rectification transformations without knowing intrinsic parameters of the
cameras and their relative position in the space, which explains the suffix "uncalibrated". Another
related difference from stereoRectify is that the function outputs not the rectification
transformations in the object (3D) space, but the planar perspective transformations encoded by the
homography matrices H1 and H2 . The function implements the algorithm @cite Hartley99 .

@note
   While the algorithm does not need to know the intrinsic parameters of the cameras, it heavily
    depends on the epipolar geometry. Therefore, if the camera lenses have a significant distortion,
    it would be better to correct it before computing the fundamental matrix and calling this
    function. For example, distortion coefficients can be estimated for each head of stereo camera
    separately by using calibrateCamera . Then, the images can be corrected using undistort , or
    just the point coordinates can be corrected with undistortPoints .

respectively (this can be done with solvePnP ), then those poses definitely relate to each other.
This means that, given ( \f$R_1\f$,\f$T_1\f$ ), it should be possible to compute ( \f$R_2\f$,\f$T_2\f$ ). You only
need to know the position and orientation of the second camera relative to the first camera. This is
what the described function does. It computes ( \f$R\f$,\f$T\f$ ) so that:

\f[R_2=R*R_1
T_2=R*T_1 + T,\f]

Optionally, it computes the essential matrix E:

\f[E= \vecthreethree{0}{-T_2}{T_1}{T_2}{0}{-T_0}{-T_1}{T_0}{0} *R\f]

where \f$T_i\f$ are components of the translation vector \f$T\f$ : \f$T=[T_0, T_1, T_2]^T\f$ . And the function
can also compute the fundamental matrix F:

\f[F = cameraMatrix2^{-T} E cameraMatrix1^{-1}\f]

Besides the stereo-related information, the function can also perform a full calibration of each of
two cameras. However, due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space and noise in the input
data, the function can diverge from the correct solution. If the intrinsic parameters can be
estimated with high accuracy for each of the cameras individually (for example, using
calibrateCamera ), you are recommended to do so and then pass CV_CALIB_FIX_INTRINSIC flag to the
function along with the computed intrinsic parameters. Otherwise, if all the parameters are
estimated at once, it makes sense to restrict some parameters, for example, pass
CV_CALIB_SAME_FOCAL_LENGTH and CV_CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST flags, which is usually a
reasonable assumption.

Similarly to calibrateCamera , the function minimizes the total re-projection error for all the
points in all the available views from both cameras. The function returns the final value of the
re-projection error.

Inverse transformation can be also done easily, since

\f[\sin ( \theta ) \vecthreethree{0}{-r_z}{r_y}{r_z}{0}{-r_x}{-r_y}{r_x}{0} = \frac{R - R^T}{2}\f]

A rotation vector is a convenient and most compact representation of a rotation matrix (since any
rotation matrix has just 3 degrees of freedom). The representation is used in the global 3D geometry
optimization procedures like calibrateCamera, stereoCalibrate, or solvePnP .

This matcher trains flann::Index_ on a train descriptor collection and calls its nearest search

collection than the brute force matcher. FlannBasedMatcher does not support masking permissible
matches of descriptor sets because flann::Index does not support this. :

@brief Class for extracting blobs from an image. :

The class implements a simple algorithm for extracting blobs from an image:

1.  Convert the source image to binary images by applying thresholding with several thresholds from
    minThreshold (inclusive) to maxThreshold (exclusive) with distance thresholdStep between
    neighboring thresholds.
2.  Extract connected components from every binary image by findContours and calculate their
    centers.
3.  Group centers from several binary images by their coordinates. Close centers form one group that
    corresponds to one blob, which is controlled by the minDistBetweenBlobs parameter.
4.  From the groups, estimate final centers of blobs and their radiuses and return as locations and
    sizes of keypoints.

This class performs several filtrations of returned blobs. You should set filterBy\* to true/false
to turn on/off corresponding filtration. Available filtrations:

-   **By color**. This filter compares the intensity of a binary image at the center of a blob to
blobColor. If they differ, the blob is filtered out. Use blobColor = 0 to extract dark blobs
and blobColor = 255 to extract light blobs.
-   **By area**. Extracted blobs have an area between minArea (inclusive) and maxArea (exclusive).
-   **By circularity**. Extracted blobs have circularity
(\f$\frac{4*\pi*Area}{perimeter * perimeter}\f$) between minCircularity (inclusive) and
maxCircularity (exclusive).
-   **By ratio of the minimum inertia to maximum inertia**. Extracted blobs have this ratio
between minInertiaRatio (inclusive) and maxInertiaRatio (exclusive).
-   **By convexity**. Extracted blobs have convexity (area / area of blob convex hull) between
minConvexity (inclusive) and maxConvexity (exclusive).

Default values of parameters are tuned to extract dark circular blobs.

@brief The ORB constructor

    @param nfeatures The maximum number of features to retain.
    @param scaleFactor Pyramid decimation ratio, greater than 1. scaleFactor==2 means the classical
    pyramid, where each next level has 4x less pixels than the previous, but such a big scale factor
    will degrade feature matching scores dramatically. On the other hand, too close to 1 scale factor
    will mean that to cover certain scale range you will need more pyramid levels and so the speed
    will suffer.
    @param nlevels The number of pyramid levels. The smallest level will have linear size equal to

    @param edgeThreshold This is size of the border where the features are not detected. It should

    @param firstLevel It should be 0 in the current implementation.
    @param WTA_K The number of points that produce each element of the oriented BRIEF descriptor. The
    default value 2 means the BRIEF where we take a random point pair and compare their brightnesses,
    so we get 0/1 response. Other possible values are 3 and 4. For example, 3 means that we take 3
    random points (of course, those point coordinates are random, but they are generated from the
    pre-defined seed, so each element of BRIEF descriptor is computed deterministically from the pixel
    rectangle), find point of maximum brightness and output index of the winner (0, 1 or 2). Such
    output will occupy 2 bits, and therefore it will need a special variant of Hamming distance,
    denoted as NORM_HAMMING2 (2 bits per bin). When WTA_K=4, we take 4 random points to compute each
    bin (that will also occupy 2 bits with possible values 0, 1, 2 or 3).
    @param scoreType The default HARRIS_SCORE means that Harris algorithm is used to rank features
    (the score is written to KeyPoint::score and is used to retain best nfeatures features);
    FAST_SCORE is alternative value of the parameter that produces slightly less stable keypoints,
    but it is a little faster to compute.

@brief "Dual TV L1" Optical Flow Algorithm.

The class implements the "Dual TV L1" optical flow algorithm described in @cite Zach2007 and
@cite Javier2012 .
Here are important members of the class that control the algorithm, which you can set after
constructing the class instance:

-   member double tau
    Time step of the numerical scheme.

-   member double lambda
    Weight parameter for the data term, attachment parameter. This is the most relevant
    parameter, which determines the smoothness of the output. The smaller this parameter is,
    the smoother the solutions we obtain. It depends on the range of motions of the images, so
    its value should be adapted to each image sequence.

-   member double theta
    Weight parameter for (u - v)\^2, tightness parameter. It serves as a link between the
    attachment and the regularization terms. In theory, it should have a small value in order
    to maintain both parts in correspondence. The method is stable for a large range of values
    of this parameter.

-   member int nscales
    Number of scales used to create the pyramid of images.

-   member int warps
    Number of warpings per scale. Represents the number of times that I1(x+u0) and grad(
    I1(x+u0) ) are computed per scale. This is a parameter that assures the stability of the
    method. It also affects the running time, so it is a compromise between speed and
    accuracy.

-   member double epsilon
    Stopping criterion threshold used in the numerical scheme, which is a trade-off between
    precision and running time. A small value will yield more accurate solutions at the
    expense of a slower convergence.

-   member int iterations
    Stopping criterion iterations number used in the numerical scheme.

@brief Finds the geometric transform (warp) between two images in terms of the ECC criterion @cite EP08 .

@param templateImage single-channel template image; CV_8U or CV_32F array.
@param inputImage single-channel input image which should be warped with the final warpMatrix in
order to provide an image similar to templateImage, same type as temlateImage.
@param warpMatrix floating-point \f$2\times 3\f$ or \f$3\times 3\f$ mapping matrix (warp).
@param motionType parameter, specifying the type of motion:
 -   **MOTION_TRANSLATION** sets a translational motion model; warpMatrix is \f$2\times 3\f$ with
     the first \f$2\times 2\f$ part being the unity matrix and the rest two parameters being
     estimated.
 -   **MOTION_EUCLIDEAN** sets a Euclidean (rigid) transformation as motion model; three
     parameters are estimated; warpMatrix is \f$2\times 3\f$.
 -   **MOTION_AFFINE** sets an affine motion model (DEFAULT); six parameters are estimated;
     warpMatrix is \f$2\times 3\f$.
 -   **MOTION_HOMOGRAPHY** sets a homography as a motion model; eight parameters are
     estimated;\`warpMatrix\` is \f$3\times 3\f$.
@param criteria parameter, specifying the termination criteria of the ECC algorithm;
criteria.epsilon defines the threshold of the increment in the correlation coefficient between two
iterations (a negative criteria.epsilon makes criteria.maxcount the only termination criterion).
Default values are shown in the declaration above.
@param inputMask An optional mask to indicate valid values of inputImage.

The function estimates the optimum transformation (warpMatrix) with respect to ECC criterion
(@cite EP08), that is

\f[\texttt{warpMatrix} = \texttt{warpMatrix} = \arg\max_{W} \texttt{ECC}(\texttt{templateImage}(x,y),\texttt{inputImage}(x',y'))\f]

where

\f[\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{bmatrix} = W \cdot \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\f]

(the equation holds with homogeneous coordinates for homography). It returns the final enhanced
correlation coefficient, that is the correlation coefficient between the template image and the
final warped input image. When a \f$3\times 3\f$ matrix is given with motionType =0, 1 or 2, the third
row is ignored.

Unlike findHomography and estimateRigidTransform, the function findTransformECC implements an
area-based alignment that builds on intensity similarities. In essence, the function updates the
initial transformation that roughly aligns the images. If this information is missing, the identity
warp (unity matrix) should be given as input. Note that if images undergo strong
displacements/rotations, an initial transformation that roughly aligns the images is necessary
(e.g., a simple euclidean/similarity transform that allows for the images showing the same image
content approximately). Use inverse warping in the second image to take an image close to the first
one, i.e. use the flag WARP_INVERSE_MAP with warpAffine or warpPerspective. See also the OpenCV
sample image_alignment.cpp that demonstrates the use of the function. Note that the function throws
an exception if algorithm does not converges.

@param err output vector of errors; each element of the vector is set to an error for the
corresponding feature, type of the error measure can be set in flags parameter; if the flow wasn't
found then the error is not defined (use the status parameter to find such cases).
@param winSize size of the search window at each pyramid level.
@param maxLevel 0-based maximal pyramid level number; if set to 0, pyramids are not used (single
level), if set to 1, two levels are used, and so on; if pyramids are passed to input then
algorithm will use as many levels as pyramids have but no more than maxLevel.
@param criteria parameter, specifying the termination criteria of the iterative search algorithm
(after the specified maximum number of iterations criteria.maxCount or when the search window
moves by less than criteria.epsilon.
@param flags operation flags:
 -   **OPTFLOW_USE_INITIAL_FLOW** uses initial estimations, stored in nextPts; if the flag is
     not set, then prevPts is copied to nextPts and is considered the initial estimate.
 -   **OPTFLOW_LK_GET_MIN_EIGENVALS** use minimum eigen values as an error measure (see
     minEigThreshold description); if the flag is not set, then L1 distance between patches
     around the original and a moved point, divided by number of pixels in a window, is used as a
     error measure.
@param minEigThreshold the algorithm calculates the minimum eigen value of a 2x2 normal matrix of
optical flow equations (this matrix is called a spatial gradient matrix in @cite Bouguet00), divided
by number of pixels in a window; if this value is less than minEigThreshold, then a corresponding
feature is filtered out and its flow is not processed, so it allows to remove bad points and get a
performance boost.

The function implements a sparse iterative version of the Lucas-Kanade optical flow in pyramids. See
@cite Bouguet00 . The function is parallelized with the TBB library.

:   Number of iterations CAMSHIFT took to converge.
The function implements the iterative object search algorithm. It takes the input back projection of
an object and the initial position. The mass center in window of the back projection image is
computed and the search window center shifts to the mass center. The procedure is repeated until the
specified number of iterations criteria.maxCount is done or until the window center shifts by less
than criteria.epsilon. The algorithm is used inside CamShift and, unlike CamShift , the search
window size or orientation do not change during the search. You can simply pass the output of
calcBackProject to this function. But better results can be obtained if you pre-filter the back
projection and remove the noise. For example, you can do this by retrieving connected components
with findContours , throwing away contours with small area ( contourArea ), and rendering the
remaining contours with drawContours.

function returns the rotated rectangle structure that includes the object position, size, and
orientation. The next position of the search window can be obtained with RotatedRect::boundingRect()

@brief Primal-dual algorithm is an algorithm for solving special types of variational problems (that is,
finding a function to minimize some functional). As the image denoising, in particular, may be seen
as the variational problem, primal-dual algorithm then can be used to perform denoising and this is
exactly what is implemented.

It should be noted, that this implementation was taken from the July 2013 blog entry
@cite MA13 , which also contained (slightly more general) ready-to-use source code on Python.
Subsequently, that code was rewritten on C++ with the usage of openCV by Vadim Pisarevsky at the end
of July 2013 and finally it was slightly adapted by later authors.

Although the thorough discussion and justification of the algorithm involved may be found in
@cite ChambolleEtAl, it might make sense to skim over it here, following @cite MA13 . To begin
with, we consider the 1-byte gray-level images as the functions from the rectangular domain of
pixels (it may be seen as set
\f$\left\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\mid 1\leq x\leq n,\;1\leq y\leq m\right\}\f$ for some
\f$m,\;n\in\mathbb{N}\f$) into \f$\{0,1,\dots,255\}\f$. We shall denote the noised images as \f$f_i\f$ and with
this view, given some image \f$x\f$ of the same size, we may measure how bad it is by the formula

\f[\left\|\left\|\nabla x\right\|\right\| + \lambda\sum_i\left\|\left\|x-f_i\right\|\right\|\f]

\f$\|\|\cdot\|\|\f$ here denotes \f$L_2\f$-norm and as you see, the first addend states that we want our
image to be smooth (ideally, having zero gradient, thus being constant) and the second states that
we want our result to be close to the observations we've got. If we treat \f$x\f$ as a function, this is
exactly the functional what we seek to minimize and here the Primal-Dual algorithm comes into play.

@param observations This array should contain one or more noised versions of the image that is to
be restored.
@param result Here the denoised image will be stored. There is no need to do pre-allocation of
storage space, as it will be automatically allocated, if necessary.
@param lambda Corresponds to \f$\lambda\f$ in the formulas above. As it is enlarged, the smooth
(blurred) images are treated more favorably than detailed (but maybe more noised) ones. Roughly
speaking, as it becomes smaller, the result will be more blur but more sever outliers will be
removed.
@param niters Number of iterations that the algorithm will run. Of course, as more iterations as
better, but it is hard to quantitatively refine this statement, so just use the default and
increase it if the results are poor.

@param src The source image

@param smoothtype Type of the smoothing, see SmoothMethod_c
@param size1 The first parameter of the smoothing operation, the aperture width. Must be a
positive odd number (1, 3, 5, ...)
@param size2 The second parameter of the smoothing operation, the aperture height. Ignored by
CV_MEDIAN and CV_BILATERAL methods. In the case of simple scaled/non-scaled and Gaussian blur if
size2 is zero, it is set to size1. Otherwise it must be a positive odd number.
@param sigma1 In the case of a Gaussian parameter this parameter may specify Gaussian \f$\sigma\f$
(standard deviation). If it is zero, it is calculated from the kernel size:
\f[\sigma  = 0.3 (n/2 - 1) + 0.8  \quad   \text{where}   \quad  n= \begin{array}{l l} \mbox{\texttt{size1} for horizontal kernel} \\ \mbox{\texttt{size2} for vertical kernel} \end{array}\f]
Using standard sigma for small kernels ( \f$3\times 3\f$ to \f$7\times 7\f$ ) gives better speed. If
sigma1 is not zero, while size1 and size2 are zeros, the kernel size is calculated from the
sigma (to provide accurate enough operation).

The function retrieves contours from the binary image using the algorithm @cite Suzuki85 . The contours
are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition. See squares.c in the

therefore the contours touching the image border will be clipped.

@param image Source, an 8-bit single-channel image. Non-zero pixels are treated as 1's. Zero
pixels remain 0's, so the image is treated as binary . You can use compare , inRange , threshold ,

The function modifies the image while extracting the contours. If mode equals to RETR_CCOMP
or RETR_FLOODFILL, the input can also be a 32-bit integer image of labels (CV_32SC1).
@param contours Detected contours. Each contour is stored as a vector of points.

as many elements as the number of contours. For each i-th contour contours[i] , the elements
hierarchy[i][0] , hiearchy[i][1] , hiearchy[i][2] , and hiearchy[i][3] are set to 0-based indices
in contours of the next and previous contours at the same hierarchical level, the first child
contour and the parent contour, respectively. If for the contour i there are no next, previous,
parent, or nested contours, the corresponding elements of hierarchy[i] will be negative.

@brief Converts an image from one color space to another.

The function converts an input image from one color space to another. In case of a transformation
to-from RGB color space, the order of the channels should be specified explicitly (RGB or BGR). Note
that the default color format in OpenCV is often referred to as RGB but it is actually BGR (the
bytes are reversed). So the first byte in a standard (24-bit) color image will be an 8-bit Blue
component, the second byte will be Green, and the third byte will be Red. The fourth, fifth, and
sixth bytes would then be the second pixel (Blue, then Green, then Red), and so on.

The conventional ranges for R, G, and B channel values are:
-   0 to 255 for CV_8U images
-   0 to 65535 for CV_16U images
-   0 to 1 for CV_32F images

In case of linear transformations, the range does not matter. But in case of a non-linear
transformation, an input RGB image should be normalized to the proper value range to get the correct
results, for example, for RGB \f$\rightarrow\f$ L\*u\*v\* transformation. For example, if you have a
32-bit floating-point image directly converted from an 8-bit image without any scaling, then it will
have the 0..255 value range instead of 0..1 assumed by the function. So, before calling cvtColor ,
you need first to scale the image down:
@code
    img *= 1./255;
    cvtColor(img, img, COLOR_BGR2Luv);
@endcode
If you use cvtColor with 8-bit images, the conversion will have some information lost. For many
applications, this will not be noticeable but it is recommended to use 32-bit images in applications
that need the full range of colors or that convert an image before an operation and then convert
back.

If conversion adds the alpha channel, its value will set to the maximum of corresponding channel
range: 255 for CV_8U, 65535 for CV_16U, 1 for CV_32F.

@example distrans.cpp
An example on using the distance transform

@brief Calculates the distance to the closest zero pixel for each pixel of the source image.

The functions distanceTransform calculate the approximate or precise distance from every binary
image pixel to the nearest zero pixel. For zero image pixels, the distance will obviously be zero.

When maskSize == DIST_MASK_PRECISE and distanceType == DIST_L2 , the function runs the
algorithm described in @cite Felzenszwalb04 . This algorithm is parallelized with the TBB library.

In other cases, the algorithm @cite Borgefors86 is used. This means that for a pixel the function
finds the shortest path to the nearest zero pixel consisting of basic shifts: horizontal, vertical,
diagonal, or knight's move (the latest is available for a \f$5\times 5\f$ mask). The overall
distance is calculated as a sum of these basic distances. Since the distance function should be
symmetric, all of the horizontal and vertical shifts must have the same cost (denoted as a ), all
the diagonal shifts must have the same cost (denoted as `b`), and all knight's moves must have the
same cost (denoted as `c`). For the cv::DIST_C and cv::DIST_L1 types, the distance is calculated
precisely, whereas for cv::DIST_L2 (Euclidean distance) the distance can be calculated only with a
relative error (a \f$5\times 5\f$ mask gives more accurate results). For `a`,`b`, and `c`, OpenCV
uses the values suggested in the original paper:
- DIST_L1: `a = 1, b = 2`
- DIST_L2:
    - `3 x 3`: `a=0.955, b=1.3693`
    - `5 x 5`: `a=1, b=1.4, c=2.1969`
- DIST_C: `a = 1, b = 1`

Typically, for a fast, coarse distance estimation DIST_L2, a \f$3\times 3\f$ mask is used. For a
more accurate distance estimation DIST_L2, a \f$5\times 5\f$ mask or the precise algorithm is used.
Note that both the precise and the approximate algorithms are linear on the number of pixels.

This variant of the function does not only compute the minimum distance for each pixel \f$(x, y)\f$
but also identifies the nearest connected component consisting of zero pixels
(labelType==DIST_LABEL_CCOMP) or the nearest zero pixel (labelType==DIST_LABEL_PIXEL). Index of the
component/pixel is stored in `labels(x, y)`. When labelType==DIST_LABEL_CCOMP, the function
automatically finds connected components of zero pixels in the input image and marks them with
distinct labels. When labelType==DIST_LABEL_CCOMP, the function scans through the input image and
marks all the zero pixels with distinct labels.

In this mode, the complexity is still linear. That is, the function provides a very fast way to
compute the Voronoi diagram for a binary image. Currently, the second variant can use only the
approximate distance transform algorithm, i.e. maskSize=DIST_MASK_PRECISE is not supported
yet.

@param src 8-bit, single-channel (binary) source image.
@param dst Output image with calculated distances. It is a 8-bit or 32-bit floating-point,
single-channel image of the same size as src.
@param labels Output 2D array of labels (the discrete Voronoi diagram). It has the type
CV_32SC1 and the same size as src.
@param distanceType Type of distance, see cv::DistanceTypes
@param maskSize Size of the distance transform mask, see cv::DistanceTransformMasks.
DIST_MASK_PRECISE is not supported by this variant. In case of the DIST_L1 or DIST_C distance type,
the parameter is forced to 3 because a \f$3\times 3\f$ mask gives the same result as \f$5\times
5\f$ or any larger aperture.
@param labelType Type of the label array to build, see cv::DistanceTransformLabelTypes.

mask using findContours and drawContours (see the watershed.cpp demo). The markers are "seeds" of
the future image regions. All the other pixels in markers , whose relation to the outlined regions
is not known and should be defined by the algorithm, should be set to 0's. In the function output,
each pixel in markers is set to a value of the "seed" components or to -1 at boundaries between the
regions.

@note Any two neighbor connected components are not necessarily separated by a watershed boundary
(-1's pixels); for example, they can touch each other in the initial marker image passed to the
function.

@param image Input 8-bit 3-channel image.
@param markers Input/output 32-bit single-channel image (map) of markers. It should have the same

@brief Computes the "minimal work" distance between two weighted point configurations.

The function computes the earth mover distance and/or a lower boundary of the distance between the
two weighted point configurations. One of the applications described in @cite RubnerSept98,
@cite Rubner2000 is multi-dimensional histogram comparison for image retrieval. EMD is a transportation
problem that is solved using some modification of a simplex algorithm, thus the complexity is
exponential in the worst case, though, on average it is much faster. In the case of a real metric
the lower boundary can be calculated even faster (using linear-time algorithm) and it can be used
to determine roughly whether the two signatures are far enough so that they cannot relate to the
same object.

@param signature1 First signature, a \f$\texttt{size1}\times \texttt{dims}+1\f$ floating-point matrix.
Each row stores the point weight followed by the point coordinates. The matrix is allowed to have
a single column (weights only) if the user-defined cost matrix is used.
@param signature2 Second signature of the same format as signature1 , though the number of rows
may be different. The total weights may be different. In this case an extra "dummy" point is added
to either signature1 or signature2 .
@param distType Used metric. See cv::DistanceTypes.
@param cost User-defined \f$\texttt{size1}\times \texttt{size2}\f$ cost matrix. Also, if a cost matrix
is used, lower boundary lowerBound cannot be calculated because it needs a metric function.
@param lowerBound Optional input/output parameter: lower boundary of a distance between the two
signatures that is a distance between mass centers. The lower boundary may not be calculated if
the user-defined cost matrix is used, the total weights of point configurations are not equal, or
if the signatures consist of weights only (the signature matrices have a single column). You
**must** initialize \*lowerBound . If the calculated distance between mass centers is greater or
equal to \*lowerBound (it means that the signatures are far enough), the function does not
calculate EMD. In any case \*lowerBound is set to the calculated distance between mass centers on
return. Thus, if you want to calculate both distance between mass centers and EMD, \*lowerBound
should be set to 0.
@param flow Resultant \f$\texttt{size1} \times \texttt{size2}\f$ flow matrix: \f$\texttt{flow}_{i,j}\f$ is
a flow from \f$i\f$ -th point of signature1 to \f$j\f$ -th point of signature2 .

@brief Calculates the back projection of a histogram.

The functions calcBackProject calculate the back project of the histogram. That is, similarly to
cv::calcHist , at each location (x, y) the function collects the values from the selected channels
in the input images and finds the corresponding histogram bin. But instead of incrementing it, the
function reads the bin value, scales it by scale , and stores in backProject(x,y) . In terms of
statistics, the function computes probability of each element value in respect with the empirical
probability distribution represented by the histogram. See how, for example, you can find and track
a bright-colored object in a scene:

- Before tracking, show the object to the camera so that it covers almost the whole frame.
Calculate a hue histogram. The histogram may have strong maximums, corresponding to the dominant
colors in the object.

- When tracking, calculate a back projection of a hue plane of each input video frame using that
pre-computed histogram. Threshold the back projection to suppress weak colors. It may also make
sense to suppress pixels with non-sufficient color saturation and too dark or too bright pixels.

- Find connected components in the resulting picture and choose, for example, the largest
component.

This is an approximate algorithm of the CamShift color object tracker.

@param images Source arrays. They all should have the same depth, CV_8U or CV_32F , and the same
size. Each of them can have an arbitrary number of channels.
@param nimages Number of source images.
@param channels The list of channels used to compute the back projection. The number of channels
must match the histogram dimensionality. The first array channels are numerated from 0 to
images[0].channels()-1 , the second array channels are counted from images[0].channels() to
images[0].channels() + images[1].channels()-1, and so on.
@param hist Input histogram that can be dense or sparse.
@param backProject Destination back projection array that is a single-channel array of the same
size and depth as images[0] .
@param ranges Array of arrays of the histogram bin boundaries in each dimension. See calcHist .

planar object, it does, up to a translation vector, if the proper R is specified.

@brief Computes the undistortion and rectification transformation map.

The function computes the joint undistortion and rectification transformation and represents the
result in the form of maps for remap. The undistorted image looks like original, as if it is
captured with a camera using the camera matrix =newCameraMatrix and zero distortion. In case of a
monocular camera, newCameraMatrix is usually equal to cameraMatrix, or it can be computed by
cv::getOptimalNewCameraMatrix for a better control over scaling. In case of a stereo camera,
newCameraMatrix is normally set to P1 or P2 computed by cv::stereoRectify .

Also, this new camera is oriented differently in the coordinate space, according to R. That, for
example, helps to align two heads of a stereo camera so that the epipolar lines on both images
become horizontal and have the same y- coordinate (in case of a horizontally aligned stereo camera).

The function actually builds the maps for the inverse mapping algorithm that is used by remap. That
is, for each pixel \f$(u, v)\f$ in the destination (corrected and rectified) image, the function
computes the corresponding coordinates in the source image (that is, in the original image from
camera). The following process is applied:
\f[\begin{array}{l} x  \leftarrow (u - {c'}_x)/{f'}_x  \\ y  \leftarrow (v - {c'}_y)/{f'}_y  \\{[X\,Y\,W]} ^T  \leftarrow R^{-1}*[x \, y \, 1]^T  \\ x'  \leftarrow X/W  \\ y'  \leftarrow Y/W  \\ x"  \leftarrow x' (1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6) + 2p_1 x' y' + p_2(r^2 + 2 x'^2)  \\ y"  \leftarrow y' (1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6) + p_1 (r^2 + 2 y'^2) + 2 p_2 x' y'  \\ map_x(u,v)  \leftarrow x" f_x + c_x  \\ map_y(u,v)  \leftarrow y" f_y + c_y \end{array}\f]
where \f$(k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3])\f$ are the distortion coefficients.

In case of a stereo camera, this function is called twice: once for each camera head, after
stereoRectify, which in its turn is called after cv::stereoCalibrate. But if the stereo camera
was not calibrated, it is still possible to compute the rectification transformations directly from
the fundamental matrix using cv::stereoRectifyUncalibrated. For each camera, the function computes
homography H as the rectification transformation in a pixel domain, not a rotation matrix R in 3D
space. R can be computed from H as
\f[\texttt{R} = \texttt{cameraMatrix} ^{-1} \cdot \texttt{H} \cdot \texttt{cameraMatrix}\f]
where cameraMatrix can be chosen arbitrarily.

@param cameraMatrix Input camera matrix \f$A=\vecthreethree{f_x}{0}{c_x}{0}{f_y}{c_y}{0}{0}{1}\f$ .
@param distCoeffs Input vector of distortion coefficients
\f$(k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3[, k_4, k_5, k_6]])\f$ of 4, 5, or 8 elements. If the vector is

@param R Optional rectification transformation in the object space (3x3 matrix). R1 or R2 ,

@brief Transforms an image to compensate for lens distortion.

The function transforms an image to compensate radial and tangential lens distortion.

The function is simply a combination of cv::initUndistortRectifyMap (with unity R ) and cv::remap
(with bilinear interpolation). See the former function for details of the transformation being
performed.

Those pixels in the destination image, for which there is no correspondent pixels in the source
image, are filled with zeros (black color).

A particular subset of the source image that will be visible in the corrected image can be regulated
by newCameraMatrix. You can use cv::getOptimalNewCameraMatrix to compute the appropriate
newCameraMatrix depending on your requirements.

The camera matrix and the distortion parameters can be determined using cv::calibrateCamera. If
the resolution of images is different from the resolution used at the calibration stage, \f$f_x,
f_y, c_x\f$ and \f$c_y\f$ need to be scaled accordingly, while the distortion coefficients remain
the same.

@brief Applies a generic geometrical transformation to an image.

The function remap transforms the source image using the specified map:

\f[\texttt{dst} (x,y) =  \texttt{src} (map_x(x,y),map_y(x,y))\f]

where values of pixels with non-integer coordinates are computed using one of available
interpolation methods. \f$map_x\f$ and \f$map_y\f$ can be encoded as separate floating-point maps
in \f$map_1\f$ and \f$map_2\f$ respectively, or interleaved floating-point maps of \f$(x,y)\f$ in
\f$map_1\f$, or fixed-point maps created by using convertMaps. The reason you might want to
convert from floating to fixed-point representations of a map is that they can yield much faster
(\~2x) remapping operations. In the converted case, \f$map_1\f$ contains pairs (cvFloor(x),
cvFloor(y)) and \f$map_2\f$ contains indices in a table of interpolation coefficients.

@brief Resizes an image.

The function resize resizes the image src down to or up to the specified size. Note that the
initial dst type or size are not taken into account. Instead, the size and type are derived from
the `src`,`dsize`,`fx`, and `fy`. If you want to resize src so that it fits the pre-created dst,
you may call the function as follows:
@code
    // explicitly specify dsize=dst.size(); fx and fy will be computed from that.
    resize(src, dst, dst.size(), 0, 0, interpolation);

If you want to decimate the image by factor of 2 in each direction, you can call the function this
way:
@code
    // specify fx and fy and let the function compute the destination image size.
    resize(src, dst, Size(), 0.5, 0.5, interpolation);
@endcode

(faster but still looks OK).

@brief Determines strong corners on an image.

The function finds the most prominent corners in the image or in the specified image region, as

-   Function calculates the corner quality measure at every source image pixel using the
    cornerMinEigenVal or cornerHarris .
-   Function performs a non-maximum suppression (the local maximums in *3 x 3* neighborhood are
    retained).
-   The corners with the minimal eigenvalue less than
    \f$\texttt{qualityLevel} \cdot \max_{x,y} qualityMeasureMap(x,y)\f$ are rejected.
-   The remaining corners are sorted by the quality measure in the descending order.
-   Function throws away each corner for which there is a stronger corner at a distance less than
    maxDistance.

The function can be used to initialize a point-based tracker of an object.

@note If the function is called with different values A and B of the parameter qualityLevel , and

@brief Refines the corner locations.

The function iterates to find the sub-pixel accurate location of corners or radial saddle points, as
shown on the figure below.

![image](pics/cornersubpix.png)

Sub-pixel accurate corner locator is based on the observation that every vector from the center \f$q\f$
to a point \f$p\f$ located within a neighborhood of \f$q\f$ is orthogonal to the image gradient at \f$p\f$
subject to image and measurement noise. Consider the expression:

\f[\epsilon _i = {DI_{p_i}}^T  \cdot (q - p_i)\f]

where \f${DI_{p_i}}\f$ is an image gradient at one of the points \f$p_i\f$ in a neighborhood of \f$q\f$ . The
value of \f$q\f$ is to be found so that \f$\epsilon_i\f$ is minimized. A system of equations may be set up
with \f$\epsilon_i\f$ set to zero:

\f[\sum _i(DI_{p_i}  \cdot {DI_{p_i}}^T) -  \sum _i(DI_{p_i}  \cdot {DI_{p_i}}^T  \cdot p_i)\f]

gradient term \f$G\f$ and the second gradient term \f$b\f$ gives:

@brief Calculates the first, second, third, or mixed image derivatives using an extended Sobel operator.

In all cases except one, the \f$\texttt{ksize} \times \texttt{ksize}\f$ separable kernel is used to
calculate the derivative. When \f$\texttt{ksize = 1}\f$, the \f$3 \times 1\f$ or \f$1 \times 3\f$
kernel is used (that is, no Gaussian smoothing is done). `ksize = 1` can only be used for the first
or the second x- or y- derivatives.

There is also the special value `ksize = CV_SCHARR (-1)` that corresponds to the \f$3\times3\f$ Scharr
filter that may give more accurate results than the \f$3\times3\f$ Sobel. The Scharr aperture is

\f[\vecthreethree{-3}{0}{3}{-10}{0}{10}{-3}{0}{3}\f]

for the x-derivative, or transposed for the y-derivative.

The function calculates an image derivative by convolving the image with the appropriate kernel:

\f[\texttt{dst} =  \frac{\partial^{xorder+yorder} \texttt{src}}{\partial x^{xorder} \partial y^{yorder}}\f]

The Sobel operators combine Gaussian smoothing and differentiation, so the result is more or less
resistant to the noise. Most often, the function is called with ( xorder = 1, yorder = 0, ksize = 3)
or ( xorder = 0, yorder = 1, ksize = 3) to calculate the first x- or y- image derivative. The first
case corresponds to a kernel of:

\f[\vecthreethree{-1}{0}{1}{-2}{0}{2}{-1}{0}{1}\f]

The second case corresponds to a kernel of:

@brief Retrieves an integer value from a file node.

The function returns an integer that is represented by the file node. If the file node is NULL, the
default_value is returned (thus, it is convenient to call the function right after cvGetFileNode
without checking for a NULL pointer). If the file node has type CV_NODE_INT, then node-\&gt;data.i is
returned. If the file node has type CV_NODE_REAL, then node-\&gt;data.f is converted to an integer
and returned. Otherwise the error is reported.

@brief Finds a node in a map or file storage.

The function finds a file node by name. The node is searched either in map or, if the pointer is
NULL, among the top-level file storage nodes. Using this function for maps and cvGetSeqElem (or
sequence reader) for sequences, it is possible to navigate through the file storage. To speed up
multiple queries for a certain key (e.g., in the case of an array of structures) one may use a
combination of cvGetHashedKey and cvGetFileNode.
@param fs File storage

(streams), starting with the first one.

@param fs File storage
@param map The parent map. If it is NULL, the function searches a top-level node. If both map and

@brief Retrieves one of the top-level nodes of the file storage.

The function returns one of the top-level file nodes. The top-level nodes do not have a name, they
correspond to the streams that are stored one after another in the file storage. If the index is out
of range, the function returns a NULL pointer, so all the top-level nodes can be iterated by
subsequent calls to the function with stream_index=0,1,..., until the NULL pointer is returned.
This function can be used as a base for recursive traversal of the file storage.
@param fs File storage
@param stream_index Zero-based index of the stream. See cvStartNextStream . In most cases,
there is only one stream in the file; however, there can be several.

The function writes an array, whose elements consist of single or multiple numbers. The function
call can be replaced with a loop containing a few cvWriteInt and cvWriteReal calls, but a single
call is more efficient. Note that because none of the elements have a name, they should be written
to a sequence rather than a map.

@brief Starts writing a new structure.

The function starts writing a compound structure (collection) that can be a sequence or a map. After
all the structure fields, which can be scalars or structures, are written, cvEndWriteStruct should
be called. The function can be used to group some objects or to implement the write function for a
some user object (see CvTypeInfo).
@param fs File storage
@param name Name of the written structure. The structure can be accessed by this name when the
storage is read.
@param struct_flags A combination one of the following values:
-   **CV_NODE_SEQ** the written structure is a sequence (see discussion of CvFileStorage ),
    that is, its elements do not have a name.
-   **CV_NODE_MAP** the written structure is a map (see discussion of CvFileStorage ), that
    is, all its elements have names.
One and only one of the two above flags must be specified
-   **CV_NODE_FLOW** the optional flag that makes sense only for YAML streams. It means that
     the structure is written as a flow (not as a block), which is more compact. It is
     recommended to use this flag for structures or arrays whose elements are all scalars.
@param type_name Optional parameter - the object type name. In
    case of XML it is written as a type_id attribute of the structure opening tag. In the case of
    YAML it is written after a colon following the structure name (see the example in
    CvFileStorage description). Mainly it is used with user objects. When the storage is read, the
    encoded type name is used to determine the object type (see CvTypeInfo and cvFindType ).

@brief Opens file storage for reading or writing data.

The function opens file storage for reading or writing data. In the latter case, a new file is
created or an existing file is rewritten. The type of the read or written file is determined by the
filename extension: .xml for XML and .yml or .yaml for YAML. The function returns a pointer to the
CvFileStorage structure. If the file cannot be opened then the function returns NULL.

@brief Converts one array to another with optional linear transformation.

conversion can not be represented exactly by a value of the destination array element type, it is
set to the nearest representable value on the real axis.

Alternatively, type info can be found by type name using cvFindType, which is used when an object

We represent a graph as a set of vertices. Vertices contain their adjacency lists (more exactly,
pointers to first incoming or outcoming edge (or 0 if isolated vertex)). Edges are stored in
another set. There is a singly-linked list of incoming/outcoming edges for each vertex.

Each edge consists of:

- Two pointers to the starting and ending vertices (vtx[0] and vtx[1] respectively).

    A graph may be oriented or not. In the latter case, edges between vertex i to vertex j are not
distinguished during search operations.

- Two pointers to next edges for the starting and ending vertices, where next[0] points to the
next edge in the vtx[0] adjacency list and next[1] points to the next edge in the vtx[1]
adjacency list.

The function returns the current number of CPU ticks on some architectures (such as x86, x64,

systems a thread, from which getCPUTickCount is called, can be suspended and resumed at another CPU
with its own counter. So, theoretically (and practically) the subsequent calls to the function do
not necessary return the monotonously increasing values. Also, since a modern CPU varies the CPU

    Each of the methods fills the matrix with the random values from the

    channel is filled independently, which means that RNG cannot generate
    samples from the multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution with
    non-diagonal covariance matrix directly. To do that, the method
    generates samples from multi-dimensional standard Gaussian distribution
    with zero mean and identity covariation matrix, and then transforms them

@brief returns uniformly distributed integer random number from [a,b) range

    The methods transform the state using the MWC algorithm and return the
    next uniformly-distributed random number of the specified type, deduced
    from the input parameter type, from the range [a, b) . There is a nuance
    illustrated by the following sample:

    @code{.cpp}
    RNG rng;

    // always produces 0
    double a = rng.uniform(0, 1);

    // produces double from [0, 1)
    double a1 = rng.uniform((double)0, (double)1);

    // produces float from [0, 1)
    double b = rng.uniform(0.f, 1.f);

    // produces double from [0, 1)
    double c = rng.uniform(0., 1.);

    // may cause compiler error because of ambiguity:
    //  RNG::uniform(0, (int)0.999999)? or RNG::uniform((double)0, 0.99999)?
    double d = rng.uniform(0, 0.999999);
    @endcode

    The compiler does not take into account the type of the variable to
    which you assign the result of RNG::uniform . The only thing that
    matters to the compiler is the type of a and b parameters. So, if you
    want a floating-point random number, but the range boundaries are
    integer numbers, either put dots in the end, if they are constants, or

        <member name="M:cv.getOptimalDFTSize(System.Int32)">
@brief Returns the optimal DFT size for a given vector size.

DFT performance is not a monotonic function of a vector size. Therefore, when you calculate
convolution of two arrays or perform the spectral analysis of an array, it usually makes sense to
pad the input data with zeros to get a bit larger array that can be transformed much faster than the
original one. Arrays whose size is a power-of-two (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...) are the fastest to process.
Though, the arrays whose size is a product of 2's, 3's, and 5's (for example, 300 = 5\*5\*3\*2\*2)
are also processed quite efficiently.

The function getOptimalDFTSize returns the minimum number N that is greater than or equal to vecsize
so that the DFT of a vector of size N can be processed efficiently. In the current implementation N
= 2 ^p^ \* 3 ^q^ \* 5 ^r^ for some integer p, q, r.

The function returns a negative number if vecsize is too large (very close to INT_MAX ).

While the function cannot be used directly to estimate the optimal vector size for DCT transform
(since the current DCT implementation supports only even-size vectors), it can be easily processed
as getOptimalDFTSize((vecsize+1)/2)\*2.

In case of the DECOMP_LU method, the function returns non-zero value if
the inverse has been successfully calculated and 0 if src is singular.

In case of the DECOMP_SVD method, the function returns the inverse
condition number of src (the ratio of the smallest singular value to the
largest singular value) and 0 if src is singular. The SVD method
calculates a pseudo-inverse matrix if src is singular.

Similarly to DECOMP_LU, the method DECOMP_CHOLESKY works only with
non-singular square matrices that should also be symmetrical and
positively defined. In this case, the function stores the inverted
matrix in dst and returns non-zero. Otherwise, it returns 0.

@brief Performs per-element division of two arrays or a scalar by an array.

The functions divide divide one array by another:

or a scalar by an array when there is no src1 :
\f[\texttt{dst(I) = saturate(scale/src2(I))}\f]

When src2(I) is zero, dst(I) will also be zero. Different channels of
multi-channel arrays are processed independently.

@note Saturation is not applied when the output array has the depth CV_32S. You may even get
result of an incorrect sign in the case of overflow.

- Difference between an array and a scalar, when src2 is constructed from Scalar or has the same

- The reverse difference between a scalar and an array in the case of `SubRS`:
    \f[\texttt{dst}(I) =  \texttt{saturate} ( \texttt{src2} -  \texttt{src1}(I) ) \quad \texttt{if mask}(I) \ne0\f]
where I is a multi-dimensional index of array elements. In case of multi-channel arrays, each
channel is processed independently.

The first function in the list above can be replaced with matrix expressions:

The input arrays and the output array can all have the same or different depths. For example, you
can add a 16-bit unsigned array to a 8-bit signed array and store the sum as a 32-bit
floating-point array. Depth of the output array is determined by the dtype parameter. In the second

@brief Forms a border around an image.

The function copies the source image into the middle of the destination image. The areas to the
left, to the right, above and below the copied source image will be filled with extrapolated
pixels. This is not what filtering functions based on it do (they extrapolate pixels on-fly), but
what other more complex functions, including your own, may do to simplify image boundary handling.

The function supports the mode when src is already in the middle of dst . In this case, the
function does not copy src itself but simply constructs the border, for example:

@code{.cpp}
    // let border be the same in all directions
    int border=2;
    // constructs a larger image to fit both the image and the border
    Mat gray_buf(rgb.rows + border*2, rgb.cols + border*2, rgb.depth());
    // select the middle part of it w/o copying data
    Mat gray(gray_canvas, Rect(border, border, rgb.cols, rgb.rows));
    // convert image from RGB to grayscale
    cvtColor(rgb, gray, COLOR_RGB2GRAY);
    // form a border in-place
    copyMakeBorder(gray, gray_buf, border, border,
                   border, border, BORDER_REPLICATE);
    // now do some custom filtering ...
    ...
@endcode
@note When the source image is a part (ROI) of a bigger image, the function will try to use the
pixels outside of the ROI to form a border. To disable this feature and always do extrapolation, as
if src was not a ROI, use borderType | BORDER_ISOLATED.

@param src Source image.
@param dst Destination image of the same type as src and the size Size(src.cols+left+right,
src.rows+top+bottom) .
@param top
@param bottom
@param left
@param right Parameter specifying how many pixels in each direction from the source image rectangle
to extrapolate. For example, top=1, bottom=1, left=1, right=1 mean that 1 pixel-wide border needs
to be built.
@param borderType Border type. See borderInterpolate for details.
@param value Border value if borderType==BORDER_CONSTANT .

nodes. Each node can be a â€śleafâ€ť that is contain a single number or a string, or be a collection of
other nodes. There can be named collections (mappings) where each element has a name and it is
accessed by a name, and ordered collections (sequences) where elements do not have names but rather
accessed by index. Type of the file node can be determined using FileNode::type method.

@brief Adjusts a submatrix size and position within the parent matrix.

    The method is complimentary to Mat::locateROI . The typical use of these functions is to determine
    the submatrix position within the parent matrix and then shift the position somehow. Typically, it
    can be required for filtering operations when pixels outside of the ROI should be taken into
    account. When all the method parameters are positive, the ROI needs to grow in all directions by the
    specified amount, for example:
    @code
        A.adjustROI(2, 2, 2, 2);
    @endcode
    In this example, the matrix size is increased by 4 elements in each direction. The matrix is shifted
    by 2 elements to the left and 2 elements up, which brings in all the necessary pixels for the
    filtering with the 5x5 kernel.

    adjustROI forces the adjusted ROI to be inside of the parent matrix that is boundaries of the
    adjusted ROI are constrained by boundaries of the parent matrix. For example, if the submatrix A is
    located in the first row of a parent matrix and you called A.adjustROI(2, 2, 2, 2) then A will not
    be increased in the upward direction.

    The function is used internally by the OpenCV filtering functions, like filter2D , morphological
    operations, and so on.

@brief Decrements the reference counter and deallocates the matrix if needed.

    The method decrements the reference counter associated with the matrix data. When the reference

    reference counter is NULL, and the method has no effect in this case.

    This method can be called manually to force the matrix data deallocation. But since this method is
    automatically called in the destructor, or by any other method that changes the data pointer, it is
    usually not needed. The reference counter decrement and check for 0 is an atomic operation on the

@brief Allocates new array data if needed.

    This is one of the key Mat methods. Most new-style OpenCV functions and methods that produce arrays
    call this method for each output array. The method uses the following algorithm:

    -# If the current array shape and the type match the new ones, return immediately. Otherwise,
       de-reference the previous data by calling Mat::release.
    -# Initialize the new header.
    -# Allocate the new data of total()\*elemSize() bytes.
    -# Allocate the new, associated with the data, reference counter and set it to 1.

    Such a scheme makes the memory management robust and efficient at the same time and helps avoid
    extra typing for you. This means that usually there is no need to explicitly allocate output arrays.
    That is, instead of writing:
    @code

        Mat gray(color.rows, color.cols, color.depth());

The keypoint is characterized by the 2D position, scale (proportional to the diameter of the

keypoint neighborhood is then analyzed by another algorithm that builds a descriptor (usually

This method is called from library when payment form detection
process finishes. Library sends list of corner points of detected
form, or empty list - that depends on what has been detected and
that information can be obtained from detectionStatus parameter.

DetectionStatus parameter gives information about detection - whether
detection has failed or has been successful. Furthermore, this parameter
can be used to get information if image is too blurry for OCR or if
it is too far away on image to perform a successful OCR.

Method should return a boolean that should inform library whether
or not it should continue to the OCR process. If this method returns false,
OCR will not be performed (this is useful for just performing payment form
detection test in different conditions without wasting time on OCR).
If this method returns true, library will continue with the OCR and recognition
process.

NOTE:	If form was not successfully detected, OCR will not be performed even if
		this method returns true. It just makes no sense to perform OCR on images
		on which payment slip is too far away on the scene or if image is blurry.

NOTE 2:	Even if OCR is not performed (either because this method returned false, or
		because form detection has not been successful, callback methods onRecognitionStarted
		and onRecognitionFinished WILL be called. The difference is just that onRecognitionFinished
		will contain empty result.

		process is performed.

Method searches for a white point in image bgrImage with search step searchStep.
The result is returned via parameter whitePoint and average gray value of traversed pixels
is returned in parameter avgGray.
NOTE: whitePoint doesn't have to be a whitest point in image. This is merely a parameter
that defines the white balance correction using implemented algorithm. For example,
in white patch algorithm, whitePoint will be the whitest point in image. On the other hand,
in grey world algorithm, whitePoint will be the average color in image.
The returned whitePoint parameter should then be given to methods updatePixelConverter
or transformFactors which will calculate the real white balance correction factors
based on whitePoint parameter.
